# Pomodoro-GUI-Application
Here's a brief description of your Pomodoro GUI application code:

The code creates a graphical Pomodoro timer using the tkinter library in Python.

It defines constants for colors, fonts, and time intervals used in the application.

The reset_timer function stops the timer, resets the display, and clears checkmarks.

The start_timer function initiates Pomodoro sessions, tracking work and breaks.

The count_down function handles the countdown timer, updating the display and managing session transitions.

The application's UI is set up with labels, buttons, and a canvas for visualizing the timer.

When the "Start" button is clicked, it triggers the Pomodoro timer.

The "Reset" button stops the timer and resets the display.

Checkmarks below the timer track completed work sessions.

The application runs in an infinite loop, waiting for user interactions.

In summary, this code creates a simple Pomodoro timer application with a user interface that allows users to start and reset timer sessions for work and breaks. It visualizes the time remaining and tracks completed work sessions with checkmarks.
